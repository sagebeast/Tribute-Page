                <h2 id="first">What Makes Martin Scorsese the Best Director of all Time</h2>
                <p id="firstpara">The world of cinema is not something conventional. The projected stories are the
                    vision of
                    certain people who can speak from the dreamiest to the most real, and there is no gender preference
                    as the story immerses the viewer to a journey that engages him throughout the film.

                    When we talk about Martin Scorsese we name one of the great directors of Hollywood. Scorsese’s films
                    date back to the 1960s, and to date have more than 20 films and 12 documentaries, so it is
                    interesting to review the work of one of the most influential directors in Western Cinema.

                </p>
                <h2 id="second">What makes him Special?</h2>
                <p id="secondpara">Scorsese always relied on people he can not only trust, but also have likes similar
                    to his own on a
                    personal level, and concerns about carrying out projects that show something new, unique to the
                    viewer. Scorsese builds his entire discourse, the whole adventure, around key pieces of cinema.

                    He is a talented director, and especially of actors. Getting the best of DiCaprio, or De Niro only
                    after a few films, is worthy of a veteran director, who connects with the story, what he needs to
                    have and with the actor selected to do it.

                    Scorsese, a director of considerable age, had chosen, as he himself said, to abandon large-scale
                    blockbusters, and to dedicate himself to a smaller but more personal budget. He is well known for
                    his risky approach on different genres and that is almost a stigma when it comes to other
                    cotemporary directors in Hollywood. He is able to get into various genres and it has really moved
                    the audience the way he did it. </p>

                <p id="conc">

                    Martin Scorsese is one of the best directors, screenwriters, and producers in the history of cinema.
                    When Martin releases a tape, one always expects the best, why it is obvious, this guy has left us at
                    least twenty films of forced viewing and more than five masterpieces.

                    He knows how to bring the story to the forefront. His creative work include risky and experimental
                    titles, but also super classic and solid productions. He is a true artist who knows how to
                    communicate his own vision of the world, and he does it in such a way that, although his films are
                    long lasting, the public loses the notion of time and ends up desiring that the story continues.
